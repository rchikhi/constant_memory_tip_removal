This software remove tips and short isolated vertices from a de bruijn graph that resides in a file, in constant memory

input: set of nodes (fasta)

output: filtered set of nodes (fasta)

Definitions:
- a tip is a node such that:
  * it has no in-neighbors xor no out-neighbors
  * mean k-mer coverage < coverage_threshold
  * node length < max_tip_length
- an isolated vertex is a node having no in-neighbor and no out-neighbor and has length < max_tip_length
- max_tip_length is set to 2k (similar to Velvet)
- coverage_threshold is a user-defined parameter

For convenience, the default memory usage is set to be exactly (2*number of distinct k-mers) bits

known bugs:
- if a node is larger than (genome_size/4) nucleotides then this software will use more than (2*genome_size) memory
